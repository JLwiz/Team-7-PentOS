---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.
In thread struct (in thread.h):
  pid_t pid - used to identify processes.
  int exit_status - used to hold the exit status of the thread.
  bool been_waited_on - used to signal if this thread has been waited on.
  struct thread parent - the threads parent.
  struct list file_list - a list of files opened by only that thread.
  struct list child_list - a list of the threads children.
  struct list_elem child_threads - child thread list element.
  struct file file - a struct to hold file information.
  int next_fd - the next file descriptor to be used.

struct file_entry (in thread.h) - the file data of a list entry.
  int fd - the file descriptor value of the file.
  struct file file - the file struct .
  char file_name - the file name.
  struct list_elem elem - the file element in the file_list.

struct child_t (in thread.h) - the thread data of a child thread.
  tid_t child_tid - the tid of the child process.
  bool exit - used to signal if this thread has exited.
  bool waited_once - used to signal if this thread has waited once.
  bool loaded - used to signal if this thread has been loaded.
  int exit_status - used to hold this threads exit value.
  struct semaphore child_sem - used to synchronize child processes when loading or waiting is needed.
  struct list_elem elem - the child element in the child_list.

struct lock file_lock (in thread.c) - used to ensure two processes aren't accessing the files at the same time.


>> A2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?
File descriptors are used to identify a file in a list and is unique to
the process. File descriptors start at 2 and increment up as a file is
open. When files are closed their file descriptors are removed from the
list, but those newly opened fds are not recycled.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.
read() and write() locate a file by its file descriptor (recieved
following a call to open()). From there they either write or read
to a provided pointer to a buffer at a prescibed length or size. 
Both methods ensure the buffer region is not located in a region
of the kernel. From there a lock is acquired to prevent multiple
processes from accessing the file data simultaneously. The number
of bytes read or written is returned.

>> A4: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.
wait() calls process_wait() by the passed pid_t - which is casted to a tid_t. Following the process wait, its status is returned. The terminated status is returned from wait().
This notifies the caller of the associated status when a process has been terminated.

The approach taken in our implementation of pintos when these bad pointers are passed in to exit the process. 
When a page fault occurs the parent
process(s) are notified and process is told to exit with its normal routine.
When an exit occurs in syscall.c it still triggers in exception handling to shut down the process and notifed its parent process(s). This strategy allows 
clean to occur and prevent resources from being held by dead processes.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A6: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?
We assert that processes that called exec are running and we await process_execute()
to return. If -1 is returned then we return -1 from the exec() method.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A8: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?



>> A9: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?
We utilized a list for file descriptors. We iterate over the list until the file
with the fd is found or NULL if no file is found. When a file is closed the file
struct is removed from the list. The advantage to this method is that it allows
fds to be stored and easily accessible. The disadvantage is the loss of O(1)
lookup when iterating over a list compared to using a hashmap for lookup.
